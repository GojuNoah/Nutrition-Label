# Nutrition-Label

This is small project 3 of 4 in the second series of projects in the Responsive Web Design certification from freecodecamp. 

This project focuses on typography and how to move text with css to build a nutrition label. It uses a wide variety of styling to get the label just how you would see one on a food box.
